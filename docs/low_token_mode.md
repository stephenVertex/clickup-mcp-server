# Low-token mode


Here is an outline of what I would like a low-token mode task to look like:

```yaml
name: "task name"
id: "abc123"
status: "todo"
priority: "high"
due_date: "2025-01-01"
description: "task description"
custom_fields:
  - name: "custom field name"
    value: "custom field value"
assignees:
  - name: "assignee name"
    id: "def456"
subtasks:
  - name: "subtask name"
    id: "sdfsds12"
    status: "todo"
```
